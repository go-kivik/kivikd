# Kivik

Package kivik provides a generic interface to CouchDB or CouchDB-like databases.

The kivik package must be used in conjunction with a database driver.

The kivik driver system is modeled after the standard library's [sql](https://golang.org/pkg/database/sql/)
and [sql/driver](https://golang.org/pkg/database/sql/driver/) packages, although
the client API is completely different due to the different database models
implemented by SQL and NoSQL databases such as CouchDB.

# Installation

Install Kivik as you normally would for any Go package:

    go get -u github.com/flimzy/kivik

This will install the main Kivik package, as well as the CouchDB and PouchDB
drivers. See the [list of Kivik database drivers](https://github.com/flimzy/kivik/wiki/Kivik-database-drivers)
for a complete list of available drivers.

# Example Usage

Please consult the the [package documentation](https://godoc.org/github.com/flimzy/kivik)
for all available API methods, and a complete usage documentation.  And for
additional usage examples, [consult the wiki](https://github.com/flimzy/kivik/wiki/Usage-Examples).

```go
package main

import (
    "context"
    "fmt"

    "github.com/flimzy/kivik"
    _ "github.com/go-kivik/couchdb" // The CouchDB driver
)

func main() {
    client, err := kivik.New(context.TODO(), "couch", "http://localhost:5984/")
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }

    db, err := client.DB(context.TODO(), "animals")
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }

    doc := map[string]interface{}{
        "_id":      "cow",
        "feet":     4,
        "greeting": "moo",
    }

    rev, err := db.Put(context.TODO(), "cow", doc)
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
    fmt.Printf("Cow inserted with revision %s\n", rev)
}
```

# Frequently Asked Questions

Nobody has ever asked me any of these questions, so they're probably better called
"Never Asked Questions" or possibly "Imagined Questions."

## Why another CouchDB client API?

Read the [design goals](https://github.com/flimzy/kivik/wiki/Design-goals) for
the general design goals.

Specifically, I was motivated to write Kivik for a few reasons:

1. I was unhappy with any of the existing CouchDB drivers for Go. The [best
one](https://github.com/fjl/go-couchdb) had a number of shortcomings:

    - It is no longer actively developed.
    - It [doesn't have an open source license](https://github.com/fjl/go-couchdb/issues/15).
    - It doesn't support iterating over result sets, forcing one to load all
      results of a query into memory at once.
    - It [doesn't support CouchDB 2.0](https://github.com/fjl/go-couchdb/issues/14)
      sequence IDs or MongoDB-style queries.
    - It doesn't natively support CookieAuth (it does allow a generic Auth method
      which could be used to do this, but I think it's appropriate to put directly
      in the library).

2. I wanted a single client API that worked with both CouchDB and
[PouchDB](https://pouchdb.com/). I had previously written
[go-pouchdb](https://github.com/flimzy/go-pouchdb), a GopherJS wrapper around
the PouchDB library with a public API modeled after `fjl/go-couchdb`, but I
still wanted a unified driver infrastructure.

3. I want an unambiguous, open source license. This software is released under
the Apache 2.0 license. See the included LICENSE.md file for details.

4. I wanted the ability to mock CouchDB connections for testing. This is possible
with the `sql` / `sql/driver` approach by implementing a mock driver, but was
not possible with any existing CouchDB client libraries. This library makes that
possible for CouchDB apps, too.

5. I wanted a simple, mock CouchDB server I could use for testing. It doesn't
need to be efficient, or support all CouchDB servers, but it should be enough
to test the basic functionality of a PouchDB app, for instance. Kivik aims to
do this with the `kivik serve` command, in the near future.

6. I wanted a toolkit that would make it easy to build a proxy to sit in front
of CouchDB to handle custom authentication or other logic that CouchDB cannot
support natively. Kivik aims to accomplish this in the future.

## What are Kivik's requirements?

Kivik's test suite is automatically run on Linux and OSX for every pull request,
but should work on all supported Go platforms.

Below are the compatibility targets for specific runtime and database versions.
If you discover a bug affecting any of these supported environments, please let
me know by submitting a bug report via GitHub.

- **Go** Kivik 1.x aims for full compatibility with all stable releases of Go from 1.7.
- **CouchDB** The Kivik 1.x CouchDB driver aims for compatibility with all stable releases of
CouchDB from 1.6.1.
- **GopherJS** GopherJS always requires the latest stable version of Go, so building Kivik with
GopherJS has this same requirement.
- **PouchDB** The Kivik 1.x PouchDB driver aims for compatibility with all stable releases of
PouchDB from 6.0.0.

## What is the development status?

Kivik comes with a complete client API client and backend drivers for CouchDB
and PouchDB.

My next priorities are to work on fleshing out the Memory driver, which will
make automated testing without a real CouchDB server easier. Then I will work
on completing the 'serve' mode.

You can see a complete overview of the current status on the
[Compatibility chart](https://github.com/flimzy/kivik/blob/master/doc/COMPATIBILITY.md)

## Why the name "Kivik"?

[Kivik](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/categories/series/18329/) is a line
of sofas (couches) from IKEA. And in the spirit of IKEA, and build-your-own
furniture, Kivik aims to allow you to "build your own" CouchDB client, server,
and proxy applications.

## What license is Kivik released under?

This software is released under the terms of the Apache 2.0 license. See
LICENCE.md, or read the [full license](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).
